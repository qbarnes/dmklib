Near term:

* continue working on support for opening existing images

* test reading a Xerox disk into raw and DMK images, and verify that
  running dmk2raw on the latter produces a raw image identical to the
  one read directly

* test ability to read DMK images from other simulators (using dmk2raw)

* test DMK images written by libdmk for readability by other programs
  (using dmk2jv3)

* support all four data marks (f8, f9, fa, fb)


Futher out:

* support timing simulation (head moves at a contant rate)

* simulation interfaces for some real FDCs:
    * 8272/uPD765
    * 1771/179x
    * 8271
    * uPD371
    * Intel iSBC-201 and iSBC-202
