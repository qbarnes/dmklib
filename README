dmklib is a library to read and write DMK format floppy disk images.
DMK format was developed by David Keil to represent floppy disk images
for use in TRS-80 simulators, and has since been adopted by other software
such as xtrs by Tim Mann and M.E.S.S.  The specifications for the DMK image
file format are available on the web:

    http://discover-net.net/~dmkeil/trs80/trstech.htm#Technical-DMK-disks

dmklib is supplied with several utility/demo programs for Linux:

    rfloppy:  read an actual floppy diskette and produce a DMK image

    dmkformat:  produce a blank formatted DMK image

    dmk2raw:  extract the data from a DMK image into a raw file

    dumpids:  read and display the sector IDs from an actual floppy diskette

dmklib and the utility/demo programs are in an *extremely* crude
state, however, they have been used successfully to read 8-inch single
and double sided, single and double density floppies.  Although some
versions have been used in the past to read 5.25-inch floppies, it is
not known whether this release will do so.  Since there has been quite
a bit of interest recently on the CCTalk mailing list in Linux
software to read floppy diskettes, I have decided to make this
prerelease available now rather than wait until I've cleaned
everything up.

Further development of dmklib will be hosted on SourceForge:
